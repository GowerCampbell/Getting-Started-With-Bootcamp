# Python Example: Password Confirmation

This example demonstrates what I’ve learned about **casting**, **input/output**, **variables**, and **Python syntax**. The program asks the user to enter a password, confirms it, and keeps track of incorrect attempts.

## Code Example

```python
# Request a password from the user
password = input("Enter a password: ")

# Confirm the password
confirm_input = input("Confirm the password: ")

# Create a list to store incorrect inputs
incorrect_inputs = []

# Use a 'while' loop to ensure the confirmed password matches the original password
while confirm_input != password:
    # Add the incorrect attempt to the 'incorrect_inputs' list
    incorrect_inputs.append(confirm_input)
    
    # Request the password again
    confirm_input = input("Password does not match. Try again: ")

# Once the passwords match, display confirmation and incorrect attempts
print("Password confirmed:", password)
print("Incorrect inputs:", incorrect_inputs)
```

## Explanation of Concepts

### 1. **Input/Output**
- The `input()` function is used to get user input. It always returns the input as a **string**.
- The `print()` function is used to display output to the user.

### 2. **Variables**
- Variables like `password`, `confirm_input`, and `incorrect_inputs` are used to store data.
- `password` stores the original password entered by the user.
- `confirm_input` stores the user’s confirmation attempt.
- `incorrect_inputs` is a list that stores all incorrect confirmation attempts.

### 3. **Casting**
- In this example, casting isn’t explicitly used because the program deals with strings. However, if we needed to work with numbers, we could use `int()` or `float()` to convert strings to numeric types.

### 4. **Python Syntax**
- **`while` Loop**: The `while` loop runs as long as the condition (`confirm_input != password`) is true. It ensures the user keeps trying until the confirmation matches the original password.
- **`!=` Operator**: This is the **not-equal-to** operator, which checks if two values are different.
- **`append()` Method**: This method adds an item to the end of a list. Here, it’s used to store incorrect password attempts.

## Example Output

```
Enter a password: mypassword123
Confirm the password: wrongpass
Password does not match. Try again: anotherwrongpass
Password does not match. Try again: mypassword123
Password confirmed: mypassword123
Incorrect inputs: ['wrongpass', 'anotherwrongpass']
```

## Key Takeaways
- **Input Handling**: Always validate user input to ensure it meets the expected format or value.
- **Loops**: Use loops like `while` to repeatedly execute code until a condition is met.
- **Lists**: Lists are useful for storing collections of data, such as incorrect password attempts.
- **String Comparison**: Python makes it easy to compare strings using operators like `==` and `!=`.

## Reflection
This example helped me understand how to combine **input/output**, **variables**, and **control structures** like loops to create interactive programs. I also learned how to use lists to store and manage data dynamically. This is a great foundation for building more complex programs in the future!

## Next Steps
- Explore handling different data types (e.g., numbers) and using casting to convert between them.
- Learn about error handling to manage invalid inputs gracefully.
- Experiment with more advanced data structures like dictionaries and sets.
