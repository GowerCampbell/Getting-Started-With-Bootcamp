# Input and Output in Python

In addition to learning about casting, I explored how to handle **input and output (I/O)** in Python. This is essential for creating interactive programs that can take user input, process it, and display results. Below are the key concepts and examples I worked through.

## 1. **User Input in Python**
The `input()` function is used to get input from the user. By default, the input is always returned as a **string**, regardless of what the user enters.

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
