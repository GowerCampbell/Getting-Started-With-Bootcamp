## Why Version Control?

Version control is a crucial skill for any developer. Using **Git** allows you to:
- **Track changes** in your code over time.
- **Collaborate** with others on projects.
- **Manage different versions** of your work efficiently.
- **Recover from mistakes** by reverting to previous versions.

By the end of this bootcamp, you'll be comfortable using Git to manage your projects and collaborate with others.
